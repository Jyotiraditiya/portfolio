      I’m Jyotiraditya Misra, a passionate full-stack developer skilled in React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB. I love building clean, responsive web apps and solving real-world problems through code.

With experience at Prodigy InfoTech and virtual training from Wells Fargo, I’ve built projects like an AI-powered Event Planner and a Smart Parking System. I’m also a DSA instructor and Co-Lead at Codhers.

Always learning. Always building.
