The /my-project/my-project/app/about directory is intended for the about page components or related files. Since you have not specified any particular files or content to include in this directory, I will create an index.tsx file that typically serves as the entry point for the about page.

Here are the contents for the /my-project/my-project/app/about/index.tsx file:

import React from 'react';

const About = () => {
    return (
        <div className="about-container">
            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>This is the about page where you can learn more about us.</p>
        </div>
    );
};

export default About;
