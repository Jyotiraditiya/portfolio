# 📧 Email Service Debugging Guide

## 🛠️ Enhanced Contact API Features

### ✅ What's Fixed/Enhanced:

1. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed console logs for production debugging
2. **Environment Variable Validation**: Checks and logs if GMAIL_USER and GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD exist
3. **Error Categorization**: Different error types with specific codes
4. **Enhanced Email Format**: HTML template with better formatting
5. **Serverless Optimization**: Connection pooling and rate limiting
6. **Debug Information**: Development mode shows detailed error info

### 🔍 Debugging Steps:

#### Step 1: Check Vercel Logs
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Navigate to your portfolio project
- Click on "Functions" tab
- Look for `/api/contact` logs
- Look for these log messages:
  - `🚀 Contact API called at:` - Confirms API is receiving requests
  - `🔍 Environment variable check:` - Shows if env vars are loaded
  - `🚨 CRITICAL: GMAIL_USER environment variable is undefined!` - Missing env var
  - `🔑 Authentication issue detected` - Gmail credential problems

#### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables in Vercel
Required variables in Vercel dashboard:
```
GMAIL_USER=misrajyotiraditya@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=[your-gmail-app-password]
```

#### Step 3: Test the API
Use this curl command to test (replace with your actual Vercel URL):
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-portfolio.vercel.app/api/contact \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test","email":"test@example.com","message":"Test message"}'
```

### 🚨 Common Error Codes:

- **AUTH_ERROR**: Gmail credentials rejected → Check app password
- **NETWORK_ERROR**: Connection failed → Usually temporary
- **TIMEOUT_ERROR**: Service timeout → Usually temporary
- **CREDENTIALS_REJECTED**: 535 error → Invalid app password

### 📋 Response Format:

**Success:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Email sent successfully",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-06T12:31:03.521Z"
}
```

**Error:**
```json
{
  "error": "Gmail authentication failed. Please check GMAIL_USER and GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD",
  "code": "AUTH_ERROR",
  "fallback": "Please contact directly at misrajyotiraditya@gmail.com",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-06T12:31:03.521Z"
}
```

### 🔧 Next Steps:

1. **Deploy to Vercel**: Changes are pushed, wait for deployment
2. **Add Environment Variables**: Ensure GMAIL_USER and GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD are set in Vercel
3. **Test on Live Site**: Use the contact form on your deployed site
4. **Check Vercel Logs**: Monitor the function logs for detailed debugging info

### 📞 Gmail App Password Setup:

1. Go to Google Account settings
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
3. Generate an App Password for "Mail"
4. Use that 16-character password (no spaces) as GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD
